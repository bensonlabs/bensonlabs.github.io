Goal
Quick command set to redeploy a clean NGINX container.

Commands
docker pull nginx
docker container stop webhost || true
docker container rm webhost || true
docker container run -p 80:80 -d --name webhost nginx

Notes
Replace port mappings as needed. Persist content by mounting a host volume to /usr/share/nginx/html.
