# bensonlabs/openaicodex

The **openaicodex** repository is the home for experiments and resources built with OpenAI's Codex and GPT-based tooling.  It documents practical workflows, reusable scripts, and automation helpers for bridging human prompts with production-ready automation.

## Project Goals
- Capture reliable automation snippets for common Codex-driven tasks.
- Maintain lightweight utilities that demonstrate how to integrate OpenAI APIs into everyday developer tooling.
- Share playbooks, lessons learned, and recommended prompt patterns for building with Codex.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bensonlabs/openaicodex.git
   ```
2. Review the `notes/` and `scripts/` directories for examples and utilities.
3. Follow the documentation updates in this README as new experiments are added.

## Structure
This initial commit seeds the repository layout.  Subsequent updates will introduce:
- `notes/`: Markdown documents describing workflows, prompts, and results.
- `scripts/`: Small utilities that demonstrate API integration patterns.
- `examples/`: End-to-end references showing Codex-driven tasks in action.

Stay tuned for iterative improvements as the repository grows.
